    "*Social media has become an integral part of modern life, transforming how we communicate, share information, and interact with the world around us. To understand the significance of social media data and its applications today, it's essential to examine the historical evolution of these platforms.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The roots of social media can be traced back to the early days of the internet. In 1997, SixDegrees.com launched as the first recognizable social network site, allowing users to create profiles and list friends. This paved the way for subsequent platforms like Friendster, MySpace, and eventually Facebook, which revolutionized the social media landscape. As these platforms grew in popularity and functionality, they began generating vast amounts of user data. This data, encompassing everything from user profiles and connections to content interactions and behavioral patterns, quickly became a valuable resource for researchers, marketers, and businesses.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The rise of social media data as a field of study and application coincided with the increasing sophistication of these platforms. Facebook's introduction of the News Feed in 2006, for instance, not only changed how users interacted with the platform but also provided a rich source of data on user preferences and behaviors. Today, social media data is used across various domains, including marketing, public health, political science, and social research. Platforms like YouTube and Reddit offer unique insights into user behavior, content consumption, and public discourse. Through APIs (application programming interfaces) provided by these platforms, researchers and developers can access and analyze this data in unprecedented ways.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In this lesson, we will focus on the practical aspects of retrieving and working with social media data. We'll explore how to use APIs to collect data from YouTube and Reddit, demonstrating the real-world applications of social media data analysis. By understanding both the historical context and current methodologies, we can better appreciate the power and potential of social media data in today's digital landscape.*"

    "## **1. What is Social Media?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide some definitions as to what social media is even though each and every one of us probably has enough exposure to such platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boyd and Ellison define social network sites as web-based services that allow individuals to\n",
    "* construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system,\n",
    "* articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and\n",
    "* view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system.\n",
    "This information highlights the structural aspects of social media, such as user profiles, connections, and network visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Merriam-Webster's Dictionary definition gives emphasis to the communication and community building aspects of social media: the social networks are forms of electronic communication (such as websites for social networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos) (\"Social media\" [*Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary*]).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Cambridge Dictionary describes social media as technological platforms: websites and computer programs that allow people to communicate and share information on the internet using a computer or mobile phone (\"Social media\" [*Cambridge Dictionary*]).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we can sum up the aspects of social media as follows:\n",
    "* User profiles and connections\n",
    "* Online communities\n",
    "* Information and content sharing\n",
    "* Technological platforms\n",
    "* User-generated content\n",
    "* Interactivity and collaboration\n",
    "* Virtual networks\n",
    "* Expression and communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above characteristics is a data-generating process. For example, the \"User profiles and connections\" part of social media generates demographic data, the social network itself (friends, followers, and connections), and personal interests and preferences. The \"Online communities\" generate group membership data, community interaction patterns, and interests/trends within different communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be clear by now that the vast amount of data generated can be used for multiple purposes that depend on the objectives of the researcher. Specifically, in the context of finance, we are very interested in the \"User-generated content\" from which we can extract:\n",
    "* text data: posts, comments\n",
    "* sentiment and opinion data\n",
    "* multimedia content related to financial topics\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is valuable for several finance-specific applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Market sentiment analysis: By analyzing the sentiment of social media posts about specific stocks, commodities, market conditions, etc., researchers can quantify public opinion.\n",
    "* Stock price prediction: Some studies have shown correlations between social media sentiment and short-term stock price changes, making this data potentially useful for trading strategies.\n",
    "* Financial news dissemination: Social media often spreads financial news faster than traditional media!\n",
    "* Risk assessment: By monitoring social media discussions, financial institutions can identify potential risks or reputational issues early.\n",
    "* Cryptocurrency trends: Given the significant role of online communities in cryptocurrency markets, social media data is particularly valuable in this sector.\n"

The green bars represent the sum of keywords like \"recession,\" \"economic crisis,\" and \"inflation\" found in YouTube comments, indicating heightened public concern. The blue line tracks the S&P 500 index price, highlighting the market's reaction during the same period.

    "### **2.2 Reddit**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is a popular social news and discussion website where users can share content and engage in conversations on various topics, including cryptocurrency. For a financial engineering student, Reddit data can give valuable examples as to how to gain insight into market sentiment and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore how to use the Reddit API to collect and analyze data related to cryptocurrency discussions. The Reddit API allows developers to access Reddit's database of posts, comments, and other content programmatically. To use the API, you'll need to create a Reddit account and register an application to obtain the necessary credentials (client ID, client secret, and user agent). At this point, you are advised to use AI instructions in order to complete this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example focuses on analyzing sentiment in cryptocurrency-related subreddits over the past month. This is due to the limitations of Reddit's API and the fact that it was not created for data analysis but merely as a tool for subreddit moderators. The code considers only the last month (the last month starting from the time you run the code cells), and for this reason, the results are expected to be different every time you run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are STRONGLY advised to not spam the cell that downloads the comments as your app will be restricted from reaching these subreddits, even though that can be corrected by creating a new app. This is a good reminder to students that sentiment analysis data do not come for free. We are bounded by API restrictions and the absence of free historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note that while we often expect sentiment analysis to align closely with price movements, this correlation isn't always perfect. Factors such as market manipulation, external news, or regulatory changes can cause divergences between sentiment and price. However, sentiment analysis remains a valuable tool for understanding market psychology and potential price directions."
